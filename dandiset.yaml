description: Pupil diameter, face motion energy, and locomotion speed measures recorded
  during sensory discrimination behavior of head-fixed mice. Subjects classify the
  frequency of an auditory tone cloud stimulus, or the angle of a drifting Gabor patch,
  at right or left lick ports. Data include 391 behavioral sessions from 13 subjects.
